# Hack ReFi

As the world gears up for COP28, a pivotal climate action event set to unfold in Dubai, UAE, from November 30 to December 12, 2023, there's an exciting opportunity happening right now for innovators and supporters alike: [Hack ReFi](https://linktr.ee/hackrefi).&#x20;

## A Catalyst for Change

[COP28](https://www.cop28.com/what-is-cop) stands as a testament to the UAE's commitment to leading energy and sustainability initiatives. This transformative event is poised to drive meaningful climate action and foster solutions that span across governments, industries, and sectors. It's a global call to action, urging us all to play our part in shaping a sustainable future.

## Regenerative Finance (ReFi) --> Beyond Sustainability

ReFi is not just about sustaining; it's about thriving. It's a [revolutionary approach to finance](https://www.investopedia.com/what-is-regenerative-finance-refi-7098179) that seeks to rejuvenate our ecosystems, communities, and economies. By aligning financial systems with the principles of the circular economy, social equity, and environmental stewardship, ReFi aims to create a harmonious balance between our economic activities and the natural world.

## The Real World Issues and Alignment

Through the last several weeks we have done the problem playoff to identify the problem-scape of the hackathon. This has resulted in various problems being identified (results here [https://www.reddit.com/r/hackrefi/comments/17bk3wv/problem\_playoff/](https://www.reddit.com/r/hackrefi/comments/17bk3wv/problem\_playoff/) ). To further guide hackers, until November 15th (when project submissions are due), we have decided to align this hackathon with the Ecological Benefits Framework (EBF) created by the Lexicon.&#x20;

## What is EBF and Lexicon&#x20;

Stakeholders from carbon markets, ReFi, blockchain, web3, conservation, regenerative agriculture, and corporate ESG reporting have convened since September 2022 to develop an equitable framework in response to climate change (and much more).

In the past year, a structured six-month sprint aligned sectors on principles and best practices to increase trust, confidence, and transparency. The goal was to support a sector-based ecological benefits marketplace, standardize corporate ESG reporting, and describe carbon projects in a standardized manner. This sprint tested the Lexicon's framework and increased adoption of it through the web3 ReFi space.

The Ecological Benefits Framework (EBF) Created by The Lexicon

\


The Lexicon, a California-based NGO, works at the intersection of conservation, sustainability, and food. In their 15 years of operation, they've collaborated with over 750 companies globally, leading the way in circular models with the Ellen McArthur Foundation, and Agrobiodiversity with the USDA, etc. Over 207 Professionals work at the Lexicon getting this framework out to the global audience (see the team here [https://www.canyouchangethefuture.org/meet-the-team/](https://www.canyouchangethefuture.org/meet-the-team/)).

Organizations that the Lexicon Collaborated with to Create the Ecological Benefits Framework

\


The framework that the Lexicon created is called the Ecological Benefits Framework (EBF). EBF is a holistic framework designed to assess and report the ecological benefits created by businesses, governments, nonprofit projects, and more. It emphasizes the positive impacts on the environment and ecosystems. Here are some key points about the EBF:

\


* Foundation: The EBF is based on shared values and principles built with stakeholders, professionals, and industry leaders, promoting a shared language for ecological benefits.
* Purpose: The EBF is used to enhance impact decisions and to measure and report the environmental and ecological benefits achieved by various entities.
* Collaboration: It's often utilized by organizations, including blockchain initiatives, as a tool to standardize reporting and reward efforts that contribute to environmental sustainability across the value chain.
* Comprehensive Assessment: The EBF evaluates benefits related to ecosystems, climate, equity, and atmospheric carbon, among other factors, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the positive impact of various activities on the environment.

\


In summary, EBF serves as a valuable tool for assessing and reporting the positive environmental and ecological impacts of various initiatives and activities, promoting sustainability and accountability in these endeavors. EBF focuses on six ecological benefits: air, water, soil, biodiversity, equity, and carbon. These ecological benefits will be the theme of this hackathon.&#x20;

“This goes beyond choosing a protocol, it's about stepping back and taking a crack at an interoperable system for the world, assets, and markets.” - Gregory Landua Regen Network

## What Funds Raised Will be Used For

The hackathon described above is our first hackathon. Now that we have the base structure set up, we want to continue bringing hacking power to the regenerative finance movement. The Commons Hub, Traditional Dream Factory and SwissDAO are communities with which we’d like to host hackathons next year. The funds will be used to further the growth of the organization and plan out next year's hackathon.
