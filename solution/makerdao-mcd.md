# MakerDAO MCD

MakerDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization that operates the Maker Protocol, a decentralized lending and stablecoin system built on the Ethereum blockchain. MakerDAO changed the world by giving us a glimpse into the future of currency, money and asset management. The humble multi-collateral DAI (MCD) showed the world that economic systems could be antifragile, trustless, decentralized and permissionless. MakerDAO’s pioneering work in decentralized stablecoins, governance and DeFi are significant achievements in the blockchain space. It became the true first generation CDP protocol. MakerDAO still had challenges to overcome. DAI didn’t scale supply with comparable capital efficiency to centralized competitors. It grew reliant on centralized real world asset providers like Circle’s USDC. People became concerned that accepting centralized stablecoins as collateral introduced fragility into the system. Other people were concerned that governance had been subverted. Some of the MKR community began to iterate on the MCD technology design.
