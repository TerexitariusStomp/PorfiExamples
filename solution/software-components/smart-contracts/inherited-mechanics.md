# Inherited Mechanics

The Azos framework sits firmly on top of the GEB reflex index. It uses an autonomous rate controller and inherits the properties of MakerDAO that are in-built to Reflexer. Azos has multi-layered security features, both collateral auctions and debt auctions. Most of the tried and true features from previous iterations remain in Azos. We removed the surplus auction mechanic; and will explore novel ways to distribute protocol owned surplus by governance. The biggest change to the GEB framework is the introduction of the Azos module.
