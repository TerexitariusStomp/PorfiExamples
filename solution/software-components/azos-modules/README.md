# Azos Modules

Azos modules are comparable to what Frax Protocol has dubbed, “algorithmic market operations controllers” or AMOs. Azos reimagines the AMO as a natural extension of the protocol. Azos modules are similar to a user generated CDP. This means that modules must work within the original tolerances and confines of the MCD and GEB systems. It also means that the inherited debt safety mechanics can rescue modules during extraordinary market turbulence.
