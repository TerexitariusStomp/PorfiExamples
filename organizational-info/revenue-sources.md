# Revenue Sources

## Protocol fees

Transaction fees are charged for every trade made on our platform, which are used to cover the costs of running the protocol.

## **Stability fees**

Users pay stability fees when they open or maintain positions, which are used to collateralize the stablecoins. These fees are determined by the Stability Module (SM) based on various factors, including the utilization rate and the overall health of the ecosystem

## Balancer Trades

As pool owners we charge a 1% fee on trades that occur with our pool's liquidity. 50% of this gets channeled to us as an organization and 50% gets channeled back to our token holders.&#x20;

## Market Making

There will be large fluctuations in the pricing of our token. We will work with a market maker to benefit from these price fluctuations.&#x20;
