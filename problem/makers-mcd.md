# Maker’s MCD

Over time more of the problems of Maker’s MCD system have been identified: ● Leaks value to unaligned participants during debt, surplus and collateral auctions. ● Pays premiums to unaligned participants for their stability during arbitrage. ● Doesn’t scale up to the demand for stable assets as effectively as a centralized issuer. ● Doesn’t direct the flow of value to aligned participants. ● Can be susceptible to cost-of-coercion attacks. ● Has a brittle static peg. ● Stability fees eat into leveraged yield.
